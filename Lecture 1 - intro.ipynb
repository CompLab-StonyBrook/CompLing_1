    "# Grading of this class\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not possible to learn programming without doing exercises. You can sit in the classroom and follow me, type in all the commands and maybe memorize them too. But when you face a novel problem there is a high chance you get stuck again. This is because learning programming is more about learning a way of thinking, i.e. the way how programmers think. Knowing basic Python syntax does not mean you know how to program in Python, anyways, you can just look Python syntax up online when you need to. That's why I suggest you do all the homework and we will discuss your solutions in class too.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have a final exam/project. Participation takes up 20%. The majority of your grade comes from your homework. Every time after the homework is due, your submission (regardless of right/wrong) counts 30% of your final grade. Then in-class discussion of your homework solutions takes up the remaining 50%. Remember, the major purpose of this class is for you to learn some coding skills in Python which facilitates your future work in computational lingusitcs. \n",
